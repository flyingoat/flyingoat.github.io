What is my connection to you?
Miles away
Years apart
Your view of the world 
From a mountain top
And for me, neck sore
Always looking up

What do you hear
Before you fall asleep?
A sweet lullaby?
Does it make you cry?

Or do those tears signify
Shattered lives
Bullet holes
And sleepless nights?

This is our connection
In the darkness
We have no protection
From systems
We did not choose
Are we destined to always be used?

Our bodies are playgrounds
For their desires
To see us fail
To keep us down
Weak, frail

This is their betrayal
This is their betrayal

We fight in the streets
Just to survive
We fight in the fields
Just to stay alive

For all those who
Just like you
Try to go to school 
We say her name
We shout her name
We never let them forget her name

In the mountain valleys
In the streets below
Their bullet holes
Their armored vehicles
Their cowardly shields
Only reveal 
That this is their betrayal
This is their betrayal

So when we go to sleep
What do we hear?
Not the sound of shattered lives
But the voices 
That cannot be silenced

We say her name
We shout her name
They will never forget her name
